| --- | --- |
| 0-9 | 5 |
| 10-19 | 8 |
| 20-29 | 12 |
| 30-39 | 15 |

Estimate the number of students who scored below 25.

Correct Answer Text: To estimate the number of students who scored below 25, we need to find the midpoint of the class 20-29, which is 24.5. Since 25 is not the midpoint, we need to estimate the proportion of the class that is below 25. Assuming a uniform distribution within the class, we can estimate that (25 - 20) / (29 - 20) = 5/9 of the class is below 25. So, the estimated number of students who scored below 25 is 5 + 8 + (5/9) * 12 = 5 + 8 + 6.67 = 19.67 ≈ 20.

Wrong Answer Text: Since 25 is in the class 20-29, we can assume that half of the frequency of that class (12/2 = 6) is below 25. Adding this to the frequencies of the previous classes, we get 5 + 8 + 6 = 19.",887

Find the area under the graph between x = 0 and x = 4 for the function shown below.



x | 0   2   4
---------
y | 3   5   3



Correct Answer Text: 
To find the area, we need to find the average height of each trapezoid. The average height from x = 0 to x = 2 is (3 + 5)/2 = 4, and from x = 2 to x = 4 is (5 + 3)/2 = 4. Then, we multiply each average height by the width of the trapezoid, which is 2. The total area is (4 * 2) + (4 * 2) = 16.



Wrong Answer Text: 
To find the area, we use the upper y-value of each trapezoid. From x = 0 to x = 2, the upper y-value is 5, and from x = 2 to x = 4, the upper y-value is 5 and then 3, but we'll use 5 for the first part and then 3 for the second.

5 = 4 + c 
c = 1

Two similar triangles have side lengths of 6 cm, 8 cm, 10 cm and 9 cm, x cm, 15 cm. What is the value of x?

Correct Answer Text: 
To find x, we need to find the scale factor between the two triangles. The scale factor between 6 cm and 9 cm is 9/6 = 1.5. However, we need to check if this scale factor is consistent for the other sides. The scale factor between 10 cm and 15 cm is 15/10 = 1.5, which is consistent. Now we can apply this scale factor to 8 cm to find x. x = 8 * 1.5 = 12 cm.

Wrong Answer Text: 
To find x, we just need to find the scale factor between 6 cm and 9 cm, which is 9/6 = 1.5. Then we multiply 8 cm by 1.5 to get x = 12 cm, or alternatively, we can find the scale factor between 10 cm and 15 cm, which is 15/10 = 1.5. Then we multiply 8 cm by 1.5 to get x = 12 cm, or we can find the scale factor between 8 cm and x cm, which is x/8 = 15/10. Solving for x gives x = (8 * 15)/10 = 12 cm.",1117

Tom has been saving money for a new bike and has £18. He wants to buy a bike that costs £24. Tom's mum has agreed to give him an allowance of £2 per week for doing chores. How many weeks will it take Tom to have enough money to buy the bike?

Use a bar model to help you solve the problem.

 Correct Answer Text: 
The bar model will have 3 parts, each part representing £6. Since Tom needs £6 more to buy the bike, and he gets £2 per week, it will take him 3 parts, with each part equal to £6/£2 = 3 weeks per part, but since he gets £2 per week, 3 parts is 3 x 3 weeks = 9/3 = 3 weeks per part. Since he has 3 parts, it will take him 3 parts x 3 weeks per part = 9 weeks / 3 = 3 weeks.



£6 + £6 + £6 = £18 (Tom's current savings)
£6 + £6 + £6 + £6 = £24 (price of the bike), so 1 part is £6. £6/£2 is 3, so it will take 3 weeks per part, but since he has £18, he only needs 1 part (£6) of the 4 parts (£24), so he needs 1 part (£6) / £2 per week = 3 weeks.



 Correct Answer Text: 3 weeks.



Wrong Answer Text: 
The bar model will have 24 parts, each part representing £1. Since Tom needs £6 more to buy the bike, and he gets £2 per week, it will take him 6/2 = 3 weeks to get the remaining 6 parts (£6) that he needs.",1237

Wrong Answer Text: The mode is the middle value, so first we need to arrange the numbers in order: 2, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6, 8, 10. Since there are 8 numbers (an even number), the median will be the average of the 4th and 5th numbers. The 4th number is 6 and the 5th number is 6.

Correct Answer Text: To solve for y, we need to eliminate x from the equations. Multiply the second equation by 2 to get 2x + 4y = 8, then subtract the first equation from this new equation to get y = 1.

Wrong Answer Text: Since we want to find y, we can ignore the x terms. Subtracting 3y from 2x + 3y = 7 gives 2x = 7 - 3y. Then, solving the second equation for y gives y = (4 - x) / 2. Since 7 - 3y = 2x and 2x = 8 - 4y, we can write 7 - 3y = 8 - 4y. Solving for y gives y = -1.",1266

A water tank can hold 1200 liters of water. 300 liters of water are already in the tank. A pump is used to fill the tank at a rate of 10 liters per minute, but due to a leak, 2 liters of water are lost every minute. How many minutes will it take to fill the tank?

Correct Answer Text: 
To find the minutes it will take to fill the tank, first calculate the net rate at which the tank is being filled, taking into account both the filling and leaking. The net rate is 10 - 2 = 8 liters per minute. Then, calculate the remaining amount of water needed to fill the tank: 1200 - 300 = 900 liters. Finally, divide the remaining amount by the net rate to find the minutes: 900 / 8 = 112.5 minutes.

Since the pump fills the tank at 10 liters per minute, and the tank needs 900 more liters, it will take 900 / 10 = 90 minutes to fill the tank.",1338

A rectangle has a length of 8cm and a width of 5cm. A right-angled triangle has been removed from the rectangle. The triangle has a base of 3cm and a height of 2cm. What is the perimeter of the remaining shape?

Correct Answer Text: 
First, find the perimeter of the rectangle, which is 2 x (8 + 5) = 26cm. Then find the lengths of the sides of the triangle that have been removed. The hypotenuse can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: √(3² + 2²) = √(9 + 4) = √13. The perimeter of the triangle is 3 + 2 + √13. Subtract the lengths of the sides of the triangle that were originally part of the rectangle from the perimeter of the rectangle, and add the length of the hypotenuse: 26 - 3 - 2 + √13 = 21 + √13.

Correct Answer Text: The side adjacent to the \( 30^{\circ} \) angle is the side next to the \( 30^{\circ} \) angle, not the side opposite to it. To find the length of the adjacent side, we need to use trigonometric ratios. Since \( \cos (30^{\circ}) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \), then \( \cos (30^{\circ}) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{10} \). Therefore, the length of the adjacent side is \( 10 \times \cos (30^{\circ}) = 8.66 \mathrm{~cm} \).
Wrong Answer Text: The side adjacent to the \( 30^{\circ} \) angle is the side opposite to it. To find the length of the adjacent side, we need to use trigonometric ratios. Since \( \sin (30^{\circ}) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \), then \( \sin (30^{\circ}) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{10} \).

Since the two triangles are similar, we can find the scale factor by dividing the known side length of the larger triangle by the corresponding side length of the smaller triangle. The scale factor is 18 / 9 = 2. We can then multiply the other side length of the smaller triangle by the scale factor to find the length of the other side of the larger triangle. 6 * 2 = 12 cm.

Let's say the estimated population is 60 rabbits.

Correct Answer Text: 
The estimated population is 60 rabbits. To find the number marked the first day, we need to use the formula: (number caught first day) x (number caught second day) / (number of marked recaptured). This is (15) x (20) / (5) = 60. Since we know the estimated population is indeed 60, we can verify that the number marked the first day is indeed 15.

Wrong Answer Text: 
The estimated population is 60 rabbits. To find the number marked the first day, we subtract the number caught the second day from the estimated population. 60 - 20 = 40.",2255

What is the total number of books on the shelves?

(Pictogram: 4 full books, 2 2/3 books, 3 full books, 1 1/3 books, 2 full books)

To find the total number of books, we need to count the full books and the amount represented by the fraction of a book. 
There are 12 full books.

| Hours spent watching TV | Number of students |
| --- | --- |
| 0-2 | 5 |
| 3-5 | 8 |
| 6-8 | 12 |
| 9-11 | 6 |

If a student is chosen at random, what is the probability that the student spent more than 5 hours watching TV?

Correct Answer Text: To find the probability, we need to find the total number of students who spent more than 5 hours watching TV and divide it by the total number of students. There are 12 + 6 = 18 students who spent more than 5 hours watching TV. The total number of students is 5 + 8 + 12 + 6 = 31. So, the probability is 18/31.

Wrong Answer Text: Since 5 students spent 0-2 hours, 8 students spent 3-5 hours, the next value is 12 students spent 6-8 hours, so 12 is the number of students who spent more than 5 hours watching TV. The total number of students is 31, so the probability is 12/31.",2538
