| Class | Frequency |
| --- | --- |
| 0-9 | 5 |
| 10-19 | 8 |
| 20-29 | 12 |
| 30-39 | 15 |

Estimate the number of students who scored below 25.

Correct Answer Text: To estimate the number of students who scored below 25, we need to find the midpoint of the class 20-29, which is 24.5. Since 25 is not the midpoint, we need to estimate the proportion of the class that is below 25. Assuming a uniform distribution within the class, we can estimate that (25 - 20) / (29 - 20) = 5/9 of the class is below 25. So, the estimated number of students who scored below 25 is 5 + 8 + (5/9) * 12 = 5 + 8 + 6.67 = 19.67 ≈ 20.

Wrong Answer Text: Since 25 is in the class 20-29, we can assume that half of the frequency of that class (12/2 = 6) is below 25. Adding this to the frequencies of the previous classes, we get 5 + 8 + 6 = 19."

Wrong Answer Text: 
Since Sara eats 1/4 of the pizza, that's 4 slices. Her brother eats 3 more, so 4 + 3 = 7 slices are eaten. 16 - 7 = 9 slices are left. Since you can't write 9 slices as a fraction, it can only be written as 9 slices."

Believes that when finding area under graph you can use the upper y value rather than average of upper and lower,"Question Text: 
Find the area under the graph between x = 0 and x = 4 for the function shown below.



x | 0   2   4
---------
y | 3   5   3



Correct Answer Text: 
To find the area, we need to find the average height of each trapezoid. The average height from x = 0 to x = 2 is (3 + 5)/2 = 4, and from x = 2 to x = 4 is (5 + 3)/2 = 4. Then, we multiply each average height by the width of the trapezoid, which is 2. The total area is (4 * 2) + (4 * 2) = 16.



Wrong Answer Text: 
To find the area, we use the upper y-value of each trapezoid. From x = 0 to x = 2, the upper y-value is 5, and from x = 2 to x = 4, the upper y-value is 5 and then 3, but we'll use 5 for the first part and then 3 for the second. Then, we multiply each upper y-value by the width of the trapezoid, which is 2. The total area is (5 * 2) + (3 * 2) = 16."

"When finding a missing length on similar shapes, just find the scale factor","Question Text: 
Two similar triangles have side lengths of 6 cm, 8 cm, 10 cm and 9 cm, x cm, 15 cm. What is the value of x?

Correct Answer Text: 
To find x, we need to find the scale factor between the two triangles. The scale factor between 6 cm and 9 cm is 9/6 = 1.5. However, we need to check if this scale factor is consistent for the other sides. The scale factor between 10 cm and 15 cm is 15/10 = 1.5, which is consistent. Now we can apply this scale factor to 8 cm to find x. x = 8 * 1.5 = 12 cm.

Wrong Answer Text: 
To find x, we just need to find the scale factor between 6 cm and 9 cm, which is 9/6 = 1.5. Then we multiply 8 cm by 1.5 to get x = 12 cm, or alternatively, we can find the scale factor between 10 cm and 15 cm, which is 15/10 = 1.5. Then we multiply 8 cm by 1.5 to get x = 12 cm, or we can find the scale factor between 8 cm and x cm, which is x/8 = 15/10. Solving for x gives x = (8 * 15)/10 = 12 cm."

Believes that 1 part of a bar model will always have a value of 1,"Question Text: 
Tom has been saving money for a new bike and has £18. He wants to buy a bike that costs £24. Tom's mum has agreed to give him an allowance of £2 per week for doing chores. How many weeks will it take Tom to have enough money to buy the bike?

Use a bar model to help you solve the problem.

 Correct Answer Text: 
The bar model will have 3 parts, each part representing £6. Since Tom needs £6 more to buy the bike, and he gets £2 per week, it will take him 3 parts, with each part equal to £6/£2 = 3 weeks per part, but since he gets £2 per week, 3 parts is 3 x 3 weeks = 9/3 = 3 weeks per part. Since he has 3 parts, it will take him 3 parts x 3 weeks per part = 9 weeks / 3 = 3 weeks.



£6 + £6 + £6 = £18 (Tom's current savings)
£6 + £6 + £6 + £6 = £24 (price of the bike), so 1 part is £6. £6/£2 is 3, so it will take 3 weeks per part, but since he has £18, he only needs 1 part (£6) of the 4 parts (£24), so he needs 1 part (£6) / £2 per week = 3 weeks.



 Correct Answer Text: 3 weeks.



Wrong Answer Text: 
The bar model will have 24 parts, each part representing £1. Since Tom needs £6 more to buy the bike, and he gets £2 per week, it will take him 6/2 = 3 weeks to get the remaining 6 parts (£6) that he needs."

Correct Answer Text: The side adjacent to the \( 30^{\circ} \) angle is the side next to the \( 30^{\circ} \) angle, not the side opposite to it. To find the length of the adjacent side, we need to use trigonometric ratios. Since \( \cos (30^{\circ}) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \), then \( \cos (30^{\circ}) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{10} \). Therefore, the length of the adjacent side is \( 10 \times \cos (30^{\circ}) = 8.66 \mathrm{~cm} \).
Wrong Answer Text: The side adjacent to the \( 30^{\circ} \) angle is the side opposite to it. To find the length of the adjacent side, we need to use trigonometric ratios. Since \( \sin (30^{\circ}) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \), then \( \sin (30^{\circ}) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{10} \). Therefore, the length of the adjacent side is \( 10 \times \sin (30^{\circ}) = 5 \mathrm{~cm} \)."

Two similar triangles have side lengths of 6 cm and 9 cm for the smaller triangle, and an unknown side length for the larger triangle. If the larger triangle has a side length of 18 cm, what is the length of the other side of the larger triangle?

Correct Answer Text: 
Since the two triangles are similar, we can find the scale factor by dividing the known side length of the larger triangle by the corresponding side length of the smaller triangle. The scale factor is 18 / 9 = 2. We can then multiply the other side length of the smaller triangle by the scale factor to find the length of the other side of the larger triangle. 6 * 2 = 12 cm.

Wrong Answer Text: 
Since the two triangles are similar, we can find the length of the other side of the larger triangle by doubling the length of the other side of the smaller triangle. 6 * 2 = 12 is incorrect, it should be 6 * (18/6) = 18 cm."

Believes you subtract the number caught second from the estimated population to find the number marked first when using the capture-recapture method,"Question Text: 
Ashley wants to know how many rabbits are in the forest near her house. She catches 15 rabbits and marks them. The next day, she catches 20 rabbits and 5 of them are marked. What is the estimated number of rabbits that were in the forest initially, and how many were marked the first day?
Let's say the estimated population is 60 rabbits.

Correct Answer Text: 
The estimated population is 60 rabbits. To find the number marked the first day, we need to use the formula: (number caught first day) x (number caught second day) / (number of marked recaptured). This is (15) x (20) / (5) = 60. Since we know the estimated population is indeed 60, we can verify that the number marked the first day is indeed 15.

Wrong Answer Text: 
The estimated population is 60 rabbits. To find the number marked the first day, we subtract the number caught the second day from the estimated population. 60 - 20 = 40."

"When counting partial symbols on pictogram, uses the fraction rather than the amount it represents","Question Text: 
A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 3 books. The pictogram below shows the number of books on the shelves.

 Book: 1 book
 fraction of a book: 1/3 book

What is the total number of books on the shelves?

(Pictogram: 4 full books, 2 2/3 books, 3 full books, 1 1/3 books, 2 full books)


Correct Answer Text: 
To find the total number of books, we need to count the full books and the amount represented by the fraction of a book. 
There are 12 full books. 
2 2/3 books is 2 and 2/3 * 3 = 2 books, so 2 2/3 books represents 2 + 2 = 4 books (round 2/3 * 3 to 2 for simplicity).
1 1/3 books is 1 and 1/3 * 3 = 1 book, so 1 1/3 books represents 1 + 1 = 2 books.
Therefore, the total number of books is 12 + 4 + 2 = 18.

However, for simplicity, the question can be adjusted to just ask about the value of 2 2/3 books.

Adjusted Question Text: 
A bookshelf has a section that can hold 3 books. The pictogram below shows the number of books on the section.

 Book: 1 book
 fraction of a book: 1/3 book

What is the total number of books on the section?


(Pictogram: 2 2/3 books)

Correct Answer Text: 
2 and 2/3 * 3 = 2 books, so 2 2/3 books represents 2 + 2 = 4 books (round 2/3 * 3 to 2 for simplicity).


Wrong Answer Text: 
2 and 2/3 books, so 2 2/3 books represents 2 + 2/3 = 2 2/3 books."

| Hours spent watching TV | Number of students |
| --- | --- |
| 0-2 | 5 |
| 3-5 | 8 |
| 6-8 | 12 |
| 9-11 | 6 |

If a student is chosen at random, what is the probability that the student spent more than 5 hours watching TV?

Correct Answer Text: To find the probability, we need to find the total number of students who spent more than 5 hours watching TV and divide it by the total number of students. There are 12 + 6 = 18 students who spent more than 5 hours watching TV. The total number of students is 5 + 8 + 12 + 6 = 31. So, the probability is 18/31.

Wrong Answer Text: Since 5 students spent 0-2 hours, 8 students spent 3-5 hours, the next value is 12 students spent 6-8 hours, so 12 is the number of students who spent more than 5 hours watching TV. The total number of students is 31, so the probability is 12/31."
