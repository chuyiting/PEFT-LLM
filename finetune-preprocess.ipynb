The probability of not rolling a 4 in one roll is 5/6. The probability of not rolling a 4 in two rolls is (5/6) × (5/6) = 25/36. So, the probability of rolling at least one 4 is 1 - 25/36 = 11/36.\\n\\nWrong Answer Text: The probability of rolling a 4 in one roll is 1/6.

Since 25 is not the midpoint, we need to estimate the proportion of the class that is below 25. Assuming a uniform distribution within the class, we can estimate that (25 - 20) / (29 - 20) = 5/9 of the class is below 25. So, the estimated number of students who scored below 25 is 5 + 8 + (5/9) * 12 = 5 + 8 + 6.67 = 19.67 ≈ 20.\\n\\nWrong Answer Text: Since 25 is in the class 20-29, we can assume that half of the frequency of that class (12/2 = 6) is below 25. Adding this to the frequencies of the previous classes, we get 5 + 8 + 6 = 19.\\n\\n    ### Response:\\n    When using interpolation to estimate frequency, assumes half the frequency of the class containing the value will be above/below it, even if it is not the midpoint<|im_end|>',\n",
